# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Model

This project is a Machine Learning based system that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using medical health parameters.

## 📌 Project Overview
The model analyzes features such as:
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- BMI
- Insulin
- Age

and predicts the likelihood of diabetes.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## 🤖 Machine Learning Process
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Prediction on New Data

## 🎯 Objective
To build an accurate and efficient diabetes prediction system for early detection.
